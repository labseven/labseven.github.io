For the class Principals of Engineering (PoE), [Evan New-Schmidt](http://chmidt.news) and I made a 3D scanner using two servo motors and an infrared distance sensor.

This was a two-person, 1.5 week project.

The most interesting part of the first PoE labs was learning how to work on a small team, regarding project management and toolchains. I had been frustrated with the Arduino IDE for quite a while, so I set up a compiling toolchain with [platformio](http://platformio.org/). This way each team member can use their preferred text editor, and it made setting up a new project easy.

The first three labs I gained valuable teaming and product management skills.

You can view the CAD of the 3D scanner on [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/56eb62590c3c78e3107526b5/w/1808d69d7f6f09bc0228630a/e/8586b0f6085399d8d7918128) and the source code on [Github](https://github.com/newsch/threed_scanner_poe).
