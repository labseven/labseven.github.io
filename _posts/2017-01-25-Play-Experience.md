For the second project in Design Nature, we teamed up to build a play experience for fourth graders inspired by an animal. Our team chose to study, and be inspired by, spiders. We found that there were many interesting traits and movements that spiders do, like web spinning, trapping, rolling, and climbing. For me, the most important takeback from the project was learning tools to make design decisions as a team, with input from every member, and strengthening the importance of rapid iteration while creating a product.

As a team, we wrote down hundreds of ideas on sticky notes. After narrowing our scope down to "navigating a web" we still had plenty of ideas, most of them feasible. This decision was the hardest to make, because it was a very open project. We turned to our design goal, and decided on building a large web out of 2x4 lumber that the children had to navigate in pairs. The simplicity of the manufacturing let us focus our effort on analyzing the gameplay, creating a satisfying game, start to finish. We decided that to make the game end properly, we had to have a physical goal that moved or made a sound when reached. For this, we designed and built a spit with a plush insect on it. When a child kicked a trigger, it quickly spun a web around the insect, resulting in a clear and satisfying end goal.
