### What we did:

* Made community software
* Did a formal design process
* Held code and design reviews
* Attempted user testing
* Software stack: jQuery, NodeJS, MongoDB, S3, AWS Lambda

### What I learned:
* Many perils about starting a service from scratch
* Importance of a useful software stack
* Important things for making lasting Software
  * What legible code looks like
  * What working with code from over three month ago feels like
  * What is useful documentation
  * Using a notebook (or notes.md) to be a more effective engineer
  * The perils of working on a small team all day, for 3 months
  * Effective ways to use git
* Perfected my desk setup
  * Standing desk with stool, monitor on swivel arm
