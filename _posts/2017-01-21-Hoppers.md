For the first project in Design Nature, we built bio-inspired hoppers. Through this project, I learned about the design process, including the importance of iteration, designing with all stakeholders in mind, and using a design goal to make decisions, and making prototypes and exploring many models before settling on a design. My design goal was "Engage college students with an inviting hopper that creates a delightful experience. The delightful experience will come from a solid and good design, an audible 'click,' and a simple and minimalist interface." My inspiration mostly came from hopping insects, which jump impressive distances for their size.

I built 4 complete iterations and dozens of minor models of subsystems before reaching the final product. The final product used a rocket engine igniter to burn through a fishing line holding the legs of the hopper closed, releasing them violently and launching it into the air. The first models were cut by hand, and the last few iterations were designed in CAD and cut with a laser cutter. Finally, I made a poster highlighting the design process and some unique aspects of the hopper.
