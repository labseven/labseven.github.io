For the first project in Design Nature, we built bio-inspired hoppers. Through this project, I learned about the design process, including the importance of iteration, designing with all stakeholders in mind, and using a design goal to make decisions, and making protoypes and exploring many models before settling on a design. My design goal was "Engage college students with an inviting hopper that creates a delightful experience. The delightful experience will come from a solid and good design, an audible 'click,' and a simple and minimalist interface." My inspiration mostly came from hopping insects, which jump impressive distances for their size.

I built 4 complete iterations and dozens of minor models of subsystems before reaching the final product. The final product used a rocket engine ignitor to burn through a fishing line holding the legs of the hopper closed, releasing them violently and launching it *cm into the air. The first models were cut by hand, and the last few iterations were designed in CAD and cut with a lasercutter. Finally, I made a poster highlighting the design process and some unique aspects of the hopper.
