title: "Passionate Pursuit: Welding"

During Fall semester of 2017, I wanted to explore art and design, and also learn to weld. I combined the two in a Passionate Pursuit in Metal Sculpture. At Olin, every semester students can do a pursue a project or skill that interests them through a Passionate Pursuit. Through these, students can get some funding and a faculty mentor for support.

I started with spot welding wire sculptures. These were mostly explorations in geometry and space. For the final project, I made a series of flowers that expressed different emotions. I cut sheet metal and scavenged pieces with our plasma cutter, bent them to shape, and welded them together with the MIG welder.

Not only was making art interesting, my welding skills were useful when I fabricated a mechanism for our [Design Nature Play Experience]({{ site.url }}/blog/20170125/Play-Experience).
