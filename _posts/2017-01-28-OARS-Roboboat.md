I am a part of the electronics subteam at the Olin Aquatic Robotics Systems (OARS). We are building a boat for the [RoboBoat](http://www.robonation.org/competition/roboboat) competition. It is essentially the famed FIRST robotics water game. The boat has to navigate a lake and complete challenges completely autonomously. Our team has about 50 people, of which 5 are on the electrical subteam.
On the electronics subteam, we speced an entirely new electronics system. We are running multiple arduinos into an ODROID, and a Pixhawk for manual override and additional sensors. We work very closely with both the hardware and software teams, to meet both physical limitations on the boat and spec all of the sensors and controllers to run the boat. The hardest part to spec were IP67 waterproof connectors that fit within our budget and were rated for 15A. Right now we are waiting for our remaining parts to arrive. We will travel to Florida in June to compete.
