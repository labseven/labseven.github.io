I went on a workshop in programmatic design with Rune Madsen in the summer 2017. Check out his [book](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/introduction/), which is a great introduction to the intersection of programming and graphic design.

The workshop was predominantly designers learning to program. I had a solid programming background, so I learned many things talking to the designers around me, and helped them explain their thoughts programmatically. The two days were very collaborative and exploratory, and I came out of it with a richer understanding of graphic design.

I kept playing with programmatic graphics, because it is talking about design in a language that I am already proficient in. I started with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and then switched to [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) for more functionality.

Bellow are a few samples of my creations. Some are static images, others are 'live' and you can interact with them.
